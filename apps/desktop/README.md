# MMP Desktop Application

This directory is reserved for the future Wails desktop application.

## Future Integration

The desktop app will bundle both:
- `apps/agent` - The Go backend
- `apps/ui` - The React frontend

Using [Wails](https://wails.io/), we'll create a native desktop application that:
- Runs the agent as an embedded service
- Serves the UI in a native window
- Provides system tray integration
- Enables offline functionality

## Status

🚧 **Not yet implemented** - This is a placeholder for future development.
